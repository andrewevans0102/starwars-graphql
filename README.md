# starwars-graphql

Project is for use with Andrew Evans post on an intro to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

Project creates a starwars characters database with GraphQL and Prisma.

Check out the [prisma server and database here](https://app.prisma.io)

Example commands that you can use in the GraphQL Playground are in the "example commands" folder.

- `query.txt` has a query that returns all the database entries
- `mutation.txt` has a mutation that writes a value to the database

Once you've installed the Prisma CLI:

- `prisma generate` creates the Prisma client
- `prisma deploy` creates a Prisma server and database
